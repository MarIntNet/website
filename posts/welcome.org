Marint.net is a network for researchers and others working with
machine learning technologies in the context of marine and aquatic
science and management.  The network is centered around a grant
proposal to EU's COST program, which we hope will finance important
activities including networking and knowledge exchange, building
important capability to leverage these tools for the benefit of our
oceans and freshwater resources.
