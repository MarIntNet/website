    <h2>The Network</h2>
    <p>
      Marint.net is a network for researchers and others working with
      machine learning technologies in the context of marine and aquatic
      science and management.  The network is centered around a grant
      proposal to EU's COST program, which we hope will finance important
      activities including networking and knowledge exchange, building
      important capability to leverage these tools for the benefit of our
      oceans and freshwater resources.  If you are interested in
      becoming a part of the network, please send me an email at
      <a href="mailto:ketil@malde.org">ketil@malde.org</a>.
